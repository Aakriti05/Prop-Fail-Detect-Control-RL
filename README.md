## Mid-flight Propeller Failure Detection and Control of Propeller-deficient Quadcopter using Reinforcement Learning

## Installation

For installation instructions please see https://github.com/leggedrobotics/raisimGym.

## Usage 

`scripts/quadcopter_position tracking.py` can be used to train RL agents as explained in the link above. To test a model, `scripts/plotting_stuff.py` can be used with the following arguments:  

`--scene`:  
0 - 4 propeller system (Default)  
1 - 3 propeller system  
2 - 2 propeller system  
3 - 4 to 3 propeller system  
4 - 3 to 2 propeller system  

`--plot`:
0 - Suppress plotting (Default)  
1 - Enable plotting
